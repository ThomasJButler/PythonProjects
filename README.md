# PythonProjects

This is a collection of Python hobby projects, ranging from climate visualisations in Project Aetheris to the terminal adventure of Ctrl-S the World.

Here's a brief overview of each project:

*   **CommandLineCalculator:** A basic command line calculator, providing a simple tool for performing arithmetic operations directly from the terminal. It's useful for quick calculations without needing a dedicated application.
*   **CtrlS:** A text based story adventure, offering an interactive narrative experience within the terminal. It combines humour and coding challenges in a unique gaming format.
*   **DevelopersOracle:** An ambitious AI powered developer assistant (currently under development), aiming to automate and streamline various software development tasks through intelligent code analysis, task planning, and communication assistance.
*   **Fibonacci:** Generates and visualises Fibonacci sequences, demonstrating a fundamental mathematical concept with both text based and graphical outputs. It's useful for exploring number patterns and visualising mathematical relationships.
*   **NumberExplorer:** Unified tool for exploring even perfect numbers (via Euclidâ€“Euler theorem) and preliminary filtering of odd perfect number candidates.
*   **Omni:** A container directory for related projects:
    *   **OmniMarket Seer (v1 & v2):** Attempts stock market prediction and sentiment analysis, exploring the use of data science techniques for financial forecasting.
    *   **OmniTechHarmony:** A system monitoring and maintenance tool (currently under development), aiming to automate tasks related to system health, security, and performance.
*   **ProjectAetheris:** Visualises global temperature and CO2 trends, pulling in data from public APIs to provide a clear picture of climate change indicators and their correlation.
*   **lorenz_chaos.py:** Simulates and visualises the Lorenz Attractor, demonstrating deterministic chaos and the Butterfly Effect, a concept with profound implications for predictability in complex systems.
